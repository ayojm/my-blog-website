    <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio </h1>
    <p> My name is Awick  welcome to my blog. I would like to give you an introduction to who I am and my joueny in the IT Industy. I am currently a part time student at Xi Academy</p>
    
    <p>I am 25 and have always found the Technology Industry something  truly inspiring but I always doubted myself as I thought it is something challenging</p>
    <p>This is my first project, though it may look really simple to someone that has been in the industry for a while this is something I'm kind of happy about as I did not need to copy anything I just created</p>
    <p>Here is my first project as I develop my skills I might look back at this and think damn thats terrible but for now pretty happy with it. </p>
